# Covid-19-Vulnerability-index
Worked on a project to calculating the vulnerability index of a patient based on his
previous medical history and analyse the risk he is surrounded by within the corona times.
A number of Machine Learning algorithms are used to calculate the best accuracy and
with the help of the ensemble approach to get the best possible accuracy and thus the
probability/vulnerability index.
